# Converting Color Images to Grayscale images in python.

## Steps

Download test images from kaggale dataset here.
Write a python script inside a jupyter notebook to do the following task:
    
    1. A function that takes path of the folder as an input.
    2. Load all the images in the given path into a numpy array.
    3. Feed that array into a OpenCV funciton.
    4. Use the function given in the code to convert the image into grayscale.
    5. Save the converted grayscale images into a seperate folder.
    6. Output the image format.
    
After following the steps the conversion will look like this:

The entire folder directory would look something like this:
